## About this project

This is the first real project I made myself. I decided to make a game not only for the sake of it but to actually use it to. <br />
I find myself, when I'm bored waiting for an appointment or even when I go for a walk with my dog, playing this game. <br />
It's nothing much but I find it pretty entertaining, hope you like it to! =) <br />

### How to use it

This is a mobile PWA app, which means you have to open the link in your smartphone browser, press "Share" and add it to your homescreen.
